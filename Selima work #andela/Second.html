        Literature is a subject that tells us the truth about our selves by telling us lies about people that never existed.</p>
      
        <p>
            See poetry is a part of literature which enables us to express ourselves in a way that the dance of words can only do. 
             </p>
       <p> Some of you reading this may have never written one and thats okay. You dont need to be a poet/poetess to love poetry.</p>
        <p>Sometimes we find it hard to express ourselves in person and we find that a pen and a piece of paper make us feel at home.</p>
<P>That's not always the case though. It honestly depends on the person.</P>
<p>Other people just like to see life through anothers eyes. </p>
<p>There are diferrent kinds of poems but one version of you.</p>
<p>So as you explore this website find whats suits you and submit your own too. So many people can be inspired by what you write.</p>
<P>But you also have to be careful because sometimes the bricks that build you can also be thrown at you.</P>
